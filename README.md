This project is a simple neural network library implemented from scratch in Python. It provides a framework for building and training neural networks using a custom auto-gradient engine. The library includes classes for defining neural network layers, neurons, network mode and for visualization of networks and their gradients. Supports common activation functions like sigmoid, tanh, and relu.

## Features

- Implementation of a custom auto-gradient engine for automatic differentiation.
- Definition of neural network layers with customizable activation functions.
- Support for common activation functions: sigmoid, tanh, and relu.
- Training loop using gradient descent optimization algorithm.
- Visualizations of computation graphs using Graphviz.

## Dependencies
The neural network library has the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Graphviz (for visualization)
